# DirSearch

Description
-----------

This project was developed in order to scan a website in an easier
way than DirBuster using Python 3.

The main reason that I used Python and not C or Java (for example)
is that I am studying C in my University degree and I want to
learn something new. 

Lastly, some functionalities that I want to implement in the future
are a bigger dictionary and Threats in order to enhance the 
efficiency.

How to use it
-------------

First of all, you have to clone this repository. For clone it,
you have to introduce the following command:

git clone https://github.com/JordiVanyo/DirSearch

When you have the repository, to execute them, write this:

python3 dirSearch.py

Introduce the URL of the website (http(s)://something.com). In order to finish,
just wait and you will have the information :D
